Molly Carroll is an (alleged) human whose profession is software engineering. She is a powerhouse (workaholic.. working on it) full stack generalist in software development and has experience in software architecture, deploying + monitoring production software, lots of DevOps and doing whatever is needed for her team's/business success.

Molly's enthusiastic SME-level technical speciality is development / solutions engineering using AI and/or machine learning. She's led a dev team to build a demo RAG chatbot for an HR client and to use in future sales pitches. She's trained dev teams directly and given larger sessions on various AI topics as a working technologist.

Her interest in computers began almost at birth, and in the early 90s she was already on her dad's Apple II and the Web when she learned how to connect via dial-up.

Many years later, when she was in the sixth grade, Molly was active on the virtual pet website Neopets, and one could customize and enhance user-owned pages such as one's profile or guild page. (This was similarly a feature of MySpace, for those who had friends at that time.) Knowing this to be possible, and discovering a [website](https://lissaexplains.com) "teaching HTML & CSS for kids!" Molly's lifelong journey of learning and building began. Mostly with clicking "View Source" on almost all websites and reading a loooootttt of code, playing with it and testing how it worked.

As her life continued, Neopets and, in general, websites that let you hack the HTML/CSS and overlay stuff and all, went wayward especially with the onset of Facebook. However, Molly had learned to code standalone websites by then and one Christmas she joyfully received her first domain name from which to host a site.

Through the years of self-teaching Molly learned JavaScript and various Node tech like Express and React, Python--which became her favorite language--with Django and Django REST Framework among other tools.

In college, she majored in English (Creative Writing emphasis)/minor in Film Studies and International Studies/minor in Philosophy while also working on code for the school admissions websites as a student worker (salary-wise). While the two Honors Bachelor of Arts degrees with which she graduated in 2015 didn't seem like much to tech recruiters when she went for her first job, but Molly could go on for ages on how these fields of study--mostly English and Philosophy--help her in her day to day work as a software engineer and in communicating for business matters in technical and non-technical scopes.

At SLU she also won a student leadership honoraria for her [founding and leadership of the school's Harry Potter/pop culture club](https://unewsonline.com/2012/09/let-us-introduce-you-molly-carroll/), and she also served an elected position on the executive board during her time in the Gamma Tau chapter of Gamma Phi Beta Sorority. College was where Molly knew and embraced that she had what it took and the desire for the responsibility of leadership. As Molly advances, the horizon could involve "tech startup founder & CEO" but most definitely involves "CEO".

Molly has participated in Denver's local business startup program and pitch accelerator called [Trout Tank](https://www.denversbdc.org/home-old/trout-tank-pitch-accelerator/). Despite lots of study and work, which paid off in lots of learning anyway, Molly's first green tech startup business model unfortunately flopped. But, it's never your first startup that hits big. She's got that out of the way now...

Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, Molly now lives in Denver, CO with her beloved cat daughter, Starfire. When not coding, Molly enjoys reading, making music and performing improv comedy at her local theater.
