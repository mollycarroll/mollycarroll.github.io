# hire me - before it's too late

A small update after much has happened: I’ve now shifted to devoting more time on my job search traditionally (interviewing as a human). On one hand, my chatbot again needs an architectural shift with some new tech that would streamline deployment to prod (will discuss later) and on the other hand, most basically, income is required for me to pay for bills.

Besides, I miss working on a team on something larger than myself. I know I could make a difference, especially in a time like this in our industry.

## what’s the deal in AI for real

As I’ve written previously, I began an intense journey independently upskilling from regular full stack developer to full stack developer including AI-based software developer in January of 2023.

It’s July 2025, and I think the open-source AI ecosystem has been transformatively disrupted (think MCP adoption/scale) at least six times or so. What does prevail, and understandably so, is the industry’s confusion about how it works, why and when to use what, and what it all means.

AI is constantly growing into improved, different, additional technology and tools to understand. From the developer standpoint, it’s more and more for me to learn how to work with, and while I adore learning constantly, it’s not what puts my current project into production... but it is, if I learn the right tech for my project’s deployment. Key words: _right_ tech.

For other roles dealing with AI, perhaps while trying to grow a company’s utilization of AI, I am sure it’s a doozie of buy-in, due diligence, research on stuff in a way different professional realm,[who the heck do we hire to do this](https://mollycarroll.dev/about/resume/) and a lot more to juggle. Even so, growing a career at a time of history like this is exciting despite lots of unknowns.
