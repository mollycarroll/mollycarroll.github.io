As a software engineer at Thoughtworks, I was eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to our company's growth. The challenge I hadn't had the opportunity to take until this project was the (to me) long strived-for role of tech lead. I partnered with PromptCamp's leader, David Chen, and I was charged with recruiting a technical team to lead full-cycle building Interview Genie, an AI-powered interviewing copilot tool designed to streamline the candidate selection process.

The goal was ambitious: create a system that could analyze live interviews, transcribe them in real-time, and provide instant feedback on how well candidates matched the job role requirements outlined in our documentation. I'm proud to say we achieved this, delivering Interview Genie with features like live transcription and real-time analysis of candidate responses against specific criteria.

The response to Interview Genie was overwhelmingly positive. Our team received high praise for its innovative approach, and it quickly became a key differentiator in AI pitches. The tool's ability to provide AI-objective insights into candidate interview answers to questions demonstrated a way to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our hiring process. This success was a testament to the hard work and dedication of my team, and I felt incredibly proud to lead them, help them and learn from them through this project.

Interview Genie also served as a valuable learning experience for me. Leading a team, managing deadlines, and navigating technical challenges while ensuring we delivered a high-quality product was a rewarding journey. I'm confident that this early experience has equipped me with the skills and confidence to lead even larger teams in the future.
