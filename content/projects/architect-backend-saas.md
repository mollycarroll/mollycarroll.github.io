My most recent work with a startup company is a great example of how diverse experiences can lead to exciting challenges and personal growth. I took on a contract role as Senior/Lead Backend Engineer for an early-stage SaaS startup, where I had the opportunity to wear many hats and contribute significantly to their SaaS offering's core architecture.

One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was leading the design and implementation of a substantial section of their online platform. I spent considerable time negotiating tradeoffs between architectural choices and business needs like time-to-market, performance requirements, and security considerations.

My skillset was put to the test as I dove deep into newer-to-me technologies: Laravel for web development, PHP for server-side logic, Neo4j for graph database management, and a variety of other backend patterns and best practices. This project demanded constant adaptation and problem-solving, pushing me to learn new tools and refine my existing skills.
