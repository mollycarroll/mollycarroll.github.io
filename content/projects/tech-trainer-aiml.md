As a software engineer at Thoughtworks, I always took steps to learn and grow within my field. That's why I was thrilled to be involved in the development of PromptCamp, our company's initiative to train our employees on advanced artificial intelligence skills.

PromptCamp (especially in the track in which I was a leader, Solution Design) is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical AI knowledge and practical application, equipping our colleagues with the skills needed to contribute meaningfully to our AI-driven projects. I was fortunate enough to be a key member of the leadership team for this project, working alongside talented engineers to design and deliver high-quality training materials.

My role as a direct trainer on the Solution Design track (for the builders...) involved providing personalized guidance and mentorship to colleagues at all skill levels. I addressed challenges they were facing in client engagements when working with AI/ML in software development and consulting. I'm particularly passionate about helping individuals grasp complex AI concepts like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, and I believe that PromptCamp has been instrumental in fostering a deeper understanding of these technologies within our team. The day I was laid off (mass reorg) I gave my last seminar on the peculiarities of AI21's model Jamba and its large context window.

The impact of PromptCamp goes beyond individual skill development; it empowers our entire organization to leverage the power of AI for innovative solutions for clients. I'm proud to have played a part in this initiative, and to the rest of the leadership team and all the amazing speakers I owe much gratitude for all I was fortunate to learn from them.
